## 💼 Professional Work

By day, I work as a developer at [iQualify](https://iqualify.com), where I:

- Build and maintain a large-scale educational platform
- Focus on accessibility, responsive UI, and clean code structure
- Collaborate on design systems, authoring tools, and analytics dashboards

Most of this work is in **private repositories**, but you can view my professional GitHub account here:

> 🛡️ Private contributions are not publicly visible, but I actively contribute to internal tools and product features at scale.
